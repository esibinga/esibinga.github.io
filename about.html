<div class="about" name="intro">
    My name is Eva Sibinga. I've spent most of my life near or in New York City and in Midcoast Maine.
    I'm passionate about equity and justice, and about bringing together data science and
    humanistic thought to cultivate a data-driven, digital future that works for everyone. I believe in the
    power of data visualization to tell stories that go beyond words and empower people to engage with some
    realities of our data-drenched world. When I'm not at my computer, I like birdwatching, watercoloring, and playing
    my violin with other people.
