        <img class="about" name="wts" src="images/gender-wc.jpeg"
            alt="Watercolor data viz representing approximately 1% population that may be trans or gender nonconforming.">


        This project was inspired by a statistic I heard almost a decade ago, that up to about 1% of the US population
        identifies as trans or gender nonconforming (TGNC). It came with the caveat that actually, we have very little
        good
        data to figure gender statistics in the US, and the number of TGNC people could be half that number, or
        potentially
        double that number. There was insufficient data to be anywhere near certain.
    </p>
    <p>
        A 2016 <a class="wtr-a"
            href='https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-Adults-US-Aug-2016.pdf'>study</a> from
        the UCLA Williams Institute is widely regarded as having the best numbers on this question,
        and it
        reported that 0.58% of the US population identifies as trans – the 95% credible intervals put that number
        anywhere
        between 0.35% and 0.95%, a difference of more than 1.5 million people. The study took its data from the
        Behavioral
        Risk Factor Surveillance System and reported estimates for all 50 states, even though only 19 states included
        the
        optional module with questions about transgender status.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 2020 Census could have been a resource for learning more about the TGNC population of the United States, but
        it
        is literally useless for trying to answer any questions about trans people. The Census asked about people’s sex,
        not
        gender, and offered only <a class="wtr-a"
            href="https://news.stlpublicradio.org/politics-issues/2020-03-17/the-2020-census-is-underway-but-nonbinary-and-gender-nonconforming-respondents-feel-counted-out">two
            categories</a>: “female” and “male.” In addition to failing to count intersex
        Americans or those with differences or disorders of sex development (potentially as much as <a class='wtr-a'
            href='https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sex-redefined-the-idea-of-2-sexes-is-overly-simplistic1/'>1%
            of the population</a>), these options don’t even touch on categories of gender identity like trans,
        two-spirit, or nonbinary.
    </p>
    <p>
        After two years of this program, and a semester specifically considering alternative data cultures, I’m
        definitely
        feeling critical of the idea that clean lines and sleek visualizations are the best way to represent the
        inherently
        complex, poorly datafied realities of sex and gender. <b> Instead, the medium should be able to gracefully
            represent
            uncertainty rather than projecting false confidence, allow space for boundary-crossing rather than requiring
            strict
            categorization, and prompt users to think critically about an idea rather than aiming to simply impart a
            number
            or
            statistic.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I settled on watercolors as one way of accomplishing this. Thinking about that 1%-but-actually-we-don’t-know
        statistic for TGNC people, I measured a square that is 1% of the painted area. Outside the square is mostly
        shades
        of blue, red and purple, and inside is mostly yellow. Some of the blues and reds seep into the square, some of
        the
        yellow leaks out, and the colors mix and abut differently at different boundaries. The square is a visible shape
        for
        reference, but by no means a concrete delineation. Rather, it signifies a potential 1% square as a point of
        context,
        with the actual area impossible to calculate.

        bringing data visualization back to its initial purpose: effective communication. Lupi’s hand-drawn approach
        (and mine) might sacrifice some level of precision or
        accuracy, but the tradeoff is hopefully some level of critical thought about the extent to which we should trust
        or
        be skeptical of conclusions that are presented as cut and dry “because data.”

    <p> Race & Visualizing [Un]classification</p>

    <img class="about" name="wts" src="images/race-wc.jpeg"
        alt="Watercolor data viz representing 2020 US Census race statistics as white bars on a backdrop of undulating earth/skin tones.">
    <p>

        Having considered one US Census question, I thought about other ways conventional data viz can prove
        counterproductive in answering complex questions. The Census categories for race were another obvious point of
        focus.
    </p>
    <p>
        The inspiration for this second watercolor is that the 2020 Census’ race categories are carved, somewhat
        arbitrarily, out of a tapestry of human origins that is endlessly more complicated than <a class='wtr-a'
            href='https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/note/US/RHI625219'>five categories and
            “some
            other race.”</a> In this visualization, the six foundational race categories for the 2020 Census are
        represented by
        the
        flat silhouette of a bar chart against a fluid backdrop of earth and/or skin tones.
    </p>
    <p>
        Part of this watercolor’s thesis is that race is invented, not discovered. There is no magical arrangement of
        words
        on the Census that will return a complete and accurate breakdown of the racial make-up of the US. The Census
        will
        always return only the answers to the questions it asks, and in doing so will continue to <i>define</i> race
        while it
        claims to <i>report</i> it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Because</i> there is no magical arrangement of words that would accurately report or define race, it’s all
        the more
        important to be comfortable with and knowledgeable of the shortcomings of any one definition. Taking the Census
        in
        its historical context is important; recognizing that whiteness is its most historically stable racial category
        is
        important; and listening to those who are dissatisfied with or confused by the categories is important.
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, the watercolor medium invites the viewer to think about layered sets and boundary-crossing rather than
        strict
        categories. In this case, the simple numbers (bars representing <a class='wtr-a'
            href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219">76.3%, 13.4%, etc.</a>) are not the point;
        the landscape
        around
        them is clearly supposed to command the viewer’s attention in this visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
        While researching census questions for this painting, I found that the historical census race questions I read
        were
        interestingly illustrative about bias. Their motivation regarding race was so obviously in service of white
        supremacy that it was easy to understand why the questions were asked in the manner they were. <a class='wtr-a'
            href='https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/25/the-changing-categories-the-u-s-has-used-to-measure-race/'>The
            1930 Census</a>
        gave
        a limited list of options for “Color or race”—these were white, Negro, Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Japanese,
        Filipino,
        Hindu, and Korean. After these categories, participants are instructed, “For a person of any other race, write
        the
        race in full.”
    </p>
    <p>
        There are obvious problems. Seven of the ten options are nationalities or religions, and only “white” remains a
        relevant term and category of race. That’s unsurprising, since racial categories in the U.S. have always
        centered a
        definition of whiteness. (The word “Negro,” by the way, wasn’t removed from the Census until <a class='wtr-a'
            href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/02/25/172885551/no-more-negro-for-census-bureau-forms-and-surveys">2013</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        But the question is incredibly instructive in its obvious lack of objectivity. The same is much harder to see in
        current day questions—many of the same white supremacist motivations remain today, but they’re couched in the
        language of modern, datafied liberalism. We expect, because as liberal subjects we are taught to view data as
        complete and objective, that answer categories should reflect the full spectrum of possibilities. It was
        actually a
        bit refreshing to pull back the curtain on liberalism and see a question that asks for the answers it wants and
        lets
        everyone who isn’t covered write in their own responses. This question is obviously oriented around white
        people,
        and it obviously wants to count different Asian populations in the United States. (Unlike today’s census, it
        actually counts Asian-American people from different origins as distinct populations.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The 1930 Census also defined categories at the level of granularity that was potentially culturally relevant,
        rather
        than pre-aggregating categories for respondents into groups that vaguely describe lots of people and
        specifically
        describe few. Indeed, <a class="wtr-a"
            href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/06/11/chapter-1-race-and-multiracial-americans-in-the-u-s-census/">according
            to the Pew Research Center</a>,
        “In the 2010 census, 37% of Hispanics—18.5 million people—said they belonged to ‘some other race.’ Among those
        who
        answered the race question this way in the 2010 census, 96.8% were Hispanic. And among those Hispanics who did,
        44.3% indicated on the form that Mexican, Mexican American or Mexico was their race, 22.7% wrote in Hispanic or
        Hispano or Hispana, and 10% wrote in Latin American or Latino or Latin.”
        When categories are insufficient or irrelevantly aggregated, people are miscounted. Visualizations predicated on
        the
        idea that census categories accurately represent “the truth” of race in America will always contribute to these
        miscounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Watercolor #2 aims to show that race categories are carved out of a field that inherently resists sterile,
        stable
        classifications, but is instead historically and socially determined.

    <p> Disability & Visualizing Responsibly</p>

        alt="Watercolor data viz representing no visualization on a background of blues and greens.">
    <p>

        Finally, I wanted to finish this series with a critique of one more category that insufficiently represents the
        people it claims to describe. Good data on disability is notoriously difficult to collect. Today, scholars of
        disability studies use qualitative data and significantly different theoretical frameworks for studying
        disability
        than the quantitative data collected largely by medical bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Evan Baughman, a friend and PhD candidate in Sociology focusing on the sociology of disability at UC Davis, told
        me
        that “‘good’ quant[itative] data on disability doesn’t really exist yet while everything on it is still under
        the
        purview of medicine.” Instead, he says, “disability studies in general is really slanted towards qualitative
        work
        because the quantitative side is pretty dominated by medicine and seen as oppressive… [T]he social model [of
        disability] is a good framework to explain why things are so bad.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Importantly, the category of “disabled” can and does mean many different things depending on the context in
        which
        its used, and it can be used to refer to groups of individuals with vastly different experiences of the world
        and
        needs in relation to disability. A statistic on “how many disabled people live in the US” is likely to be, at
        best,
        mostly unhelpful in its broadness, and at worst, misleading and/or damaging in how it defines disability.
    </p>
    <p>
        The social model of disability rejects overmedicalized, individualist perspectives on disability and points
        instead
        to disability as a “culturally and historically specific phenomenon” (Tom Shakespeare, <a class='wtr-a'
            href='http://thedigitalcommons.org/docs/shakespeare_social-model-of-disability.pdf'>"The Social Model of
            Disability"</a>). From an alternative
        data
        cultures perspective, it’s apparent how conventional categorizations of people as disabled may be futile,
        irrelevant, or arbitrary for data analysis/viz purposes, and in fact we might be better served and more
        responsible
        practitioners by cataloging the ways in which societies define ability in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Baughman also pointed out a few examples of potential logistical pitfalls that arise when quantifying
        disability.
        For one, deaf people frequently don’t self-report as disabled and claim to be a linguistic group. For another,
        many
        more poor people and people of color won’t be diagnosed with a disability simply because they can’t get to a
        doctor,
        despite the fact that they are disabled at higher rates. And in general, the healthcare system is the driver
        behind
        quantitative disability data collection, so as long as inequities and disparities regarding socioeconomic
        status,
        gender, race, geography and more exist within healthcare, these will be reproduced in our data about disability.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m by no means well-versed in disability studies, but I’m certainly looking forward to reading more after this
        experience. As far as data viz is concerned, I’m grateful to have some baseline ideas to consider.
        First and foremost, visualizations about disability and disabled people should be made and considered with
        caution and care towards representing relevant categorical distinctions, and presented with sufficient
        qualitative context to explain the shortcomings of quantitative or categorical approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        In lieu of this, my final watercolor aims to represent a field for which data visualization may tell us little
        to
        nothing. There is no graph, because it may be better, at this point, to use data viz sparingly and with context,
        or
        not at all. The fully painted “extradiegetic” space and lack of a “diegetic” visualization also alludes to the
        reality of disability as distinct from impairment, and culturally and historically determined rather than an
        intrinsically “true” or stable
        category.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Conclusion

    </p>
    <p>This project has convinced me of the merits of bringing watercolors into my practice as a data viz developer. I
        love how the medium foregrounds uncertainty, liminality, and variability in its visual language, and there are
        obvious use cases for bringing that language to the field of data visualization. I’ve also found that
        approaching data viz from a more overtly artistic standpoint has encouraged me to think critically about the
        ways in which data sets are constructions of reality, not simply representations. As far as responsible data viz
        practice goes, both of these are crucial considerations, and I’m excited to see how this deep reflection on an
        analog process will inform my future digital data visualizations. </p>
